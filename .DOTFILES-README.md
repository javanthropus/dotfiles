# Dotfiles

This repository is intended to be cloned to the root of your home directory so
that it's easy to manage all of your files via git. While you could use a backup
system, such snapshots lack metadata that may be valuable later when attempting
to understand the history of the tracked files.

## Installation

```
curl -s https://github.com/javanthropus/dotfiles/raw/refs/heads/master/.dotfiles-install.sh | bash
```

These commands will clone this repository directly into your home directory,
adopting its content. **Note that any files managed by this repository will
immediately replace those that already exist in the tree. All changes will be
lost.**

## Usage

This repository includes a `.bashrc` file that defines the following alias:

```
alias dotfiles='git --git-dir $HOME/.dotfiles'
```

Use the `dotfiles` alias in place of the `git` command when managing the
repository content. The repository is configured to ignore untracked files in
commands such as `dotfiles status`.
